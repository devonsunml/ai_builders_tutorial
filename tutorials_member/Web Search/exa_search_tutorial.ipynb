    "This notebook provides a concise introduction to Exa, an AI-powered search engine for LLMs. Exa enables semantic (neural) searches, keyword searches, and auto mode for optimal results. Key features include searching the web, finding similar pages, retrieving contents, and building research agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important concepts:\n",
    "- **Search Types**: Neural (semantic understanding), Keyword (exact matches), Auto (best of both).\n",
    "- **Endpoints**: Search, search_and_contents, find_similar, get_contents.\n",
    "- **Filters**: Dates, domains, categories.\n",
    "- **Contents Options**: Text, highlights, summaries.\n",
    "- **Integrations**: With OpenAI for synthesis, LangChain for agents.\n",
    "- **Best Practices**: Use natural language queries, limit results, handle API keys securely, combine with LLMs for reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover installation, basic usage, advanced features, and a simple researcher agent. "
