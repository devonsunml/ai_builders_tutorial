    "# CrewAI Tutorial: Building Multi-Agent AI Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is CrewAI?\n",
    "\n",
    "CrewAI is an open-source Python framework designed to orchestrate role-playing, autonomous AI agents that collaborate to tackle complex tasks. Think of it as building a team where each AI agent has specialized skills and responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Agents**\n",
    "Think of an agent as a specialized team member with specific skills, expertise, and responsibilities. For example, a Researcher agent might excel at gathering and analyzing information, while a Writer agent might be better at creating content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Tasks**\n",
    "Tasks are specific assignments given to agents. Each task defines what needs to be accomplished, expected outcomes, and which agent should handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Crews**\n",
    "A crew is a structured group of agents and tasks that work together to complete a process. Crews orchestrate the collaboration between multiple agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Tools**\n",
    "This enables agents to perform tasks beyond their core capabilities, such as retrieving information from the web or performing complex data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build a **Content Research and Writing System** with:\n",
    "- **Research Agent**: Gathers information on topics\n",
    "- **Writer Agent**: Creates articles based on research\n",
    "- **Editor Agent**: Reviews and improves content\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the power of multi-AI agent systems that exceed the performance of prompting a single LLM by designing and prompting a team of AI agents."
