# AI Builders Tutorial

A comprehensive, hands-on tutorial series for building AI applications using modern frameworks and tools. Learn through interactive Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanations and practical examples.

## What You'll Learn

Each tutorial is designed to be practical and immediately applicable:

- **Hands-on Examples**: Every concept includes working code you can run and modify
- **Real-world Applications**: Build actual projects, not just toy examples
- **Best Practices**: Learn industry-standard approaches and common pitfalls to avoid
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with basics and advance to sophisticated implementations

All tutorials are interactive Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and code examples you can run yourself.
