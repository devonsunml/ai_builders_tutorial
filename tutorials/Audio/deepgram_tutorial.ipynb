      "Another big problem in the speech analytics space, when customers first bring the software on is that they they are blown away by the fact that an engine can monitor hundreds of KPIs. Right? Everything from minute compliance issues to, you know, human, human interaction, empathy measurements, to upsell, aptitudes, to closing aptitudes. There are hundreds, literally, of KPIs that one can look at. And the speech analytics companies have typically gone to the customer and really bang that drum. Look at all of these things that we're gonna help you keep an eye on. The reality, however, is that a company even a contact center manager, they can't keep track in their brain, even if they have a report in front of them, of that many KPIs. Mhmm. And, frankly, it's overwhelming. So what successful companies do is they bite off no more than they can chew at any given time. The reality is is you can only train a call center agent on a maximum of three skills at any given day. Right? And by focusing on, focusing on problem areas for a week, for a month, depending on how bad things are, and then once you've mastered that skill, to take a baseline of of your performance and move on to the next worst skill, right, is the way that companies succeed using this product.\n"

      "Speaker 1: No. Aristotle thought the flames would stop at some point at their natural place in the sky, but I can understand how you'd be confused. Aristotle's ideas seem odd to us today. Now, there was another early scientist whose ideas on gravity may seem more familiar. An ancient Indian thinker from the five hundreds, Brahmagupta, that was his name. He believed that the earth was basically a giant ball that was full of gravity and pulled things down to it. So around earth with its own gravitational pull, just like we believe today. Now, yes, Susie. Well, actually, Susie, the theory the world is round is a very old one. In fact, it was during Aristotle's life that some of his fellow Greek scientist realized the Earth had to be round. In many ways, this idea of a round earth was the first step toward our modern understanding of gravity. And, Brahmaguptha took that a step further realizing there was gravity within the sphere of the earth. Now, Aristotle was right too in a sense. Things can fall at different speeds, but, that's because of differences in air resistance. The atmosphere or counteracting gravity when it hits things that are not so compact, not not dense. Aristotle, Ramagupta, other ancient thinkers were missing an important theory, well, a fact. I'm talking about heliocentrism, the idea the earth isn't the center of the universe, that it revolves around the sun. That idea became popular much later in the fifteen hundreds. Does anyone know who Copernicus is? Roger? Well, he wasn't punished, but he did get a lot of grief from religious leaders at the time. The idea certainly wasn't traditional, but other scientists and the public, they embraced his ideas about planetary orbits. This new scientific attention to orbits set the stage for Newton to realize that gravity made things fall to the earth, but they also made the moon circle the earth. And then Newton figured out what we all know now. Larger objects have gravitational power over smaller ones.\n",
      "Speaker 2: Sorry. I I'm confused again. I thought nobody knew the Earth was round until people sailed all the way around the world in in, like, the fourteen or fifteen hundreds. How did Brahmagupta figure out the world was round?\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "Speaker 0 is confused about the idea that the Earth is a giant ball and pulled things down to it. Speaker 1 explains that the theory of a round Earth was discussed by a Greek scientist named Braheler during the early stages of the Discovery process, but it became popular later in the hundreds. Other scientists and the public embraced the idea of a rotating body and the idea of a moon, but it was not traditional.\n"
