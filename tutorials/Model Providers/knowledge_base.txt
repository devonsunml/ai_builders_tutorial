Together AI offers a cloud platform for building and running generative AI. It provides access to over 100 open-source models.
The platform is designed for high-performance inference, leveraging techniques like speculative decoding.
For Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Together AI offers both embedding models and reranker models.
The BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 is a popular and powerful model for generating text embeddings.
Reranking is a crucial step in a RAG pipeline to improve the quality of retrieved documents before sending them to the language model.
The Together AI Python client is compatible with the OpenAI API, making it easy for developers to switch.
Users can fine-tune models on their own data to create specialized, expert models.
Together AI offers both serverless, pay-as-you-go endpoints and dedicated instances for large-scale applications.
