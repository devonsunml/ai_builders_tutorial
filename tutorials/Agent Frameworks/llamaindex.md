# Getting Started with LlamaIndex

LlamaIndex is a powerful framework for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. This tutorial will guide you through the fundamentals of LlamaIndex and show you how to build your first RAG application.

## What is LlamaIndex?

LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index) is a data framework for Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It provides tools to:

- **Connect** your LLM to external data sources
- **Structure** your data for optimal retrieval
- **Query** your data using natural language

## Key Concepts

### 1. Documents and Nodes

- **Documents**: Raw data sources (PDFs, text files, web pages)
- **Nodes**: Processed chunks of documents optimized for retrieval

### 2. Indexes

Different types of indexes for different use cases:

- **Vector Store Index**: For semantic similarity search
- **Tree Index**: For hierarchical summarization
- **Keyword Table Index**: For exact keyword matching

### 3. Query Engines

Query engines process your natural language questions and return relevant answers by:

1. Retrieving relevant context from your indexed data
2. Synthesizing a response using an LLM

## Basic Workflow

The typical LlamaIndex workflow involves:

1. **Data Loading**: Import your documents
2. **Indexing**: Process and store documents in an index
3. **Querying**: Ask questions and get answers

## Example Use Cases

- **Knowledge Base Q&A**: Build chatbots that can answer questions about your documentation
- **Research Assistant**: Create tools that can analyze and summarize large document collections
- **Content Recommendation**: Build systems that suggest relevant content based on user queries

## Next Steps

In the upcoming tutorials, we'll dive deeper into:

- Setting up your first LlamaIndex application
- Working with different document types
- Customizing retrieval strategies
- Building production-ready RAG systems
