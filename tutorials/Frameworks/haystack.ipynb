    "# Haystack Tutorial: Building Your First RAG Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this tutorial on **Haystack**! Haystack is an open-source framework for building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides the tools to build powerful and flexible applications like question-answering systems, semantic search, and complex, multi-step agentic workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll focus on one of the most common and powerful use cases: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. A RAG pipeline allows your LLM to answer questions based on your own data, which helps to ground the model's responses in facts and reduce hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Core Haystack Concepts**: We'll get to know the essential building blocks of Haystack.\n",
    "* **Building a RAG Pipeline**: We'll construct a simple pipeline to answer questions about a set of documents.\n",
    "* **Running the Pipeline**: We'll see how to execute the pipeline and get answers to our questions."

    "* **`SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder`**: This component converts our `Documents` into numerical representations (embeddings) that capture their semantic meaning.\n",
    "* **`SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder`**:  This component converts a text query into an embedding.\n",
    "* **`InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever`**: This component retrieves the most relevant documents from the `InMemoryDocumentStore` based on the similarity between the query embedding and the document embeddings.\n",
    "* **`PromptBuilder`**: This component creates a prompt from a template and the retrieved documents, which will be sent to the LLM.\n",
    "* **`HuggingFaceAPIGenerator`**: This component interacts with a Hugging Face model to generate a response based on the prompt.\n",
    "* **`Pipeline`**: A `Pipeline` connects all these components together to form a coherent workflow."

The capital is actually Paris' neighbor to the east, the city of Paris being the similarly-named pr√©fecture of the √éle-de-France region, which contains many suburbs of Paris, such as Disneyland Paris. The capital of France is Paris' northern neighbor, the city of Versailles. In fact, Paris proper is administratively part of the d√©partement (county) of Seine-Saint-Denis, which is itself part of the r√©gion (region or state, roughly comparable to a U.S. State) of √éle-de-France, which contains many other arrondissements (municipalities, roughly comparable to U.S. Cities), such as Saint-Denis, Aubervilliers, and Neuilly-sur-Seine, which in turn are part of the d√©partement of Hauts-de-Seine, which is part of √éle-de-France. The capital of France is the city of Paris. The capital is Paris. The formal name of the city is la Ville de Paris (French: [la v√¨: d…ô pa:riz].
