    "## 1. Introduction and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LangChain?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It simplifies the entire lifecycle of LLM application development, including development, productionization, and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chains & LCEL:** Chains are sequences of operations (like prompts, models, and parsers) that can be composed using the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and the `|` (pipe) operator for flexible, declarative workflows.\n",
    "- **Components:** LangChain provides modular building blocks:\n",
    "  - **Models:** Interfaces for LLMs, chat, and embedding models from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.\n",
    "  - **Prompts:** Templates for dynamic, parameterized prompt construction.\n",
    "  - **Output Parsers:** Convert LLM outputs into structured formats (strings, JSON, Pydantic models, etc.).\n",
    "  - **Memory:** Tools for maintaining state across chain runs, supporting context retention.\n",
    "  - **Tools:** External functions/APIs that can be called by the LLM during execution.\n",
    "- **Retrievers & RAG:** Retrievers fetch relevant data from sources (like vector stores or databases) to augment LLM responses. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrievers and LLMs for up-to-date, domain-specific answers.\n",
    "- **Document Loaders & Text Splitters:** Utilities for ingesting and chunking data from various sources for use in retrieval pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's install the necessary packages."

      "❓ Question: How can I use few-shot examples in my prompts?\n",
      "🎯 Answer: Few-shot examples can be effectively used in your prompts to guide the model's responses by providing context and specific examples of the desired output. Here’s how you can do it:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Define the Task Clearly**: Start by clearly stating what you want the model to do. This sets the stage for the examples you will provide.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Provide Examples**: Include a few examples that illustrate the input-output pairs. Each example should show a clear relationship between the input and the expected output. Typically, 2-5 examples are sufficient for few-shot prompting.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Use a Consistent Format**: Make sure the format of your examples is consistent. This helps the model understand the pattern it should follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **End with a New Input**: After providing the examples, include the new input you want the model to respond to. This should be in the same format as the examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Keep It Concise**: While examples are important, keep your prompt concise to avoid overwhelming the model with too much information.\n",
      "\n",
